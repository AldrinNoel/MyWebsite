             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve always wondered why life feels so uneven. Like, why some people are born into comfort while others have to struggle just to keep up. Growing up, I noticed these more and more, and honestly, it made me question a lot of things. We all live on the same planet, but it sometimes feels like we’re living in completely different worlds. I didn’t realize it back then, but that curiosity slowly turned into jealousy. Not the loud kind, just the quiet type that sits in the back of your mind and makes you compare yourself to everyone else. I didn’t start out this way, but somewhere along the road, especially during my high school years, I kind of lost track of what I actually wanted for myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was younger, things felt simpler. I didn’t care much about status or popularity, and I didn’t really think about how I looked to other people. But once high school came around, everything changed. Social conformity became an immense pressure. There were cliques, rankings, and unspoken rules about how you were supposed to act and who you were supposed to be friends with. I had a hard time adjusting, and most days it felt like I was just trying to survive socially. I started paying attention to what other people had, their confidence, their popularity, their opportunities, and I couldn’t help but feel like I was always one step behind.
        </p>

        <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the pandemic happened, and for the first time, everything slowed down. I was away from everyone else, away from expectations, and honestly, it felt kind of freeing. During that time, I started doing things just because I wanted to. I began drawing and singing, not to impress anyone, but because it made me feel good. I even created social media accounts for my art, and surprisingly, people actually noticed. My following grew to around 3.5k, and that attention felt validating. At that moment, I thought I finally figured it out. I wanted to be rich, famous, and free. It felt like I was finally becoming someone worth noticing.
        </p>

        <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when the pandemic ended and we went back to school, reality hit again. Social pressure came rushing back, and I felt like I needed to keep up this version of myself that people seemed to like. I wanted more recognition, more approval, so I changed myself. I tried to be friends with everyone, to fit in everywhere. Somewhere along the way, though, something felt off. I couldn’t explain it, but I felt empty, like I was chasing something that kept moving further away. Graduation came with achievements, praise, and recognition, but instead of feeling fulfilled, I felt nothing. That’s when I realized the truth. I didn’t actually want success for myself, I just wanted to be envied.
        </p>

        <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduating senior high school, things became clearer. What I truly wanted wasn’t fame or validation. It was time. Time for myself, time to spend with people I care about, time to explore things without pressure, and time to live freely. I wanted the ability to fail without fear and rest without guilt. For the first time, I stopped asking what would impress others and started asking what would actually make me feel at peace.
        </p>

  

        <p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back, I realize that finding out what you actually want in life isn’t something that happens instantly. It takes confusion, comparison, and sometimes even disappointment to understand yourself better. I spent years chasing approval and trying to become someone impressive, only to realize that none of it mattered if I wasn’t happy. What I want now is simpler, but it feels more real. I want time, freedom, and the space to grow at my own pace. I’m still figuring things out, and honestly, I probably always will be. But at least now, I’m learning to choose myself over expectations, and that alone makes the journey feel worth it.
