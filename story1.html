        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            I have this thing where I would think through situations and stay calm, when it feels like a solution is absolutely needed. When things get serious, my brain just kind of locks in and starts working. It helps, but it’s also stressful
            having to rely on it too often strains not only my mental health but also physically. Over time, it became an instinct something that guides me during the tougher
            moments of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            There was this one experience I had in high school that changed how I saw AI. It wasn’t anything dramatic, just a normal school day, but the way it happened made me stop and think about learning, pressure, and how much we actually rely on convenience.

            It was just a regular day, and we were given an in-class assignment. Naturally, I would’ve just used AI. That felt like the obvious choice. But for some reason, I felt this rush inside of me telling me to stop.
            And I actually did. I paused, looked to my left, then to my right, and saw that almost everyone was already done.
That’s when I felt this strange emptiness. Not jealousy, just this quiet thought sitting in my head
            is the future generation going to be alright? I didn’t have much time to think about it though,
            because the situation quickly became urgent.
The teacher announced that there were only ten minutes left. Adrenaline kicked in, and my instincts
            took over. There really wasn’t another option, so I used AI. In an instant, the essay was done.
            All that was left was to submit it on time.
 But when I read the first paragraph of the two-paragraph essay, it didn’t feel right.
            It didn’t sound like me. So I revised it, changing the wording and structure until it felt more like
            something I would actually write.
      With one minute left, my computer suddenly lost its internet connection. I refreshed the page again
            and again until the submission page finally appeared. With only seconds left, I dragged my downloaded
            PDF into the submission box and submitted it just in time.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            In the end, I didn’t feel remorse. I felt happy, exalted, and satisfied. Not because AI did the work,
            but because I still stepped in and made choices. That moment made it clear to me that AI wasn’t the end
            it was an eye-opener.
        </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            AI is an evolution that forcefully requires people to adapt to its endless capabilities. There’s no shaking it off.
            The moment people realized how convenient it was, it became engraved into society, just like calculators.
            What matters now is whether we stay involved in the thinking or let convenience take over completely.
