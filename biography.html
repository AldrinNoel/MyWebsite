<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I was a kid I never really understood how the world worked, nothing seemed wrong to me, I thought “things just happened”.<sup>1</sup>
Like there’s no permanent consequences to the things you do.<sup>2</sup>
Well, the thing is, one choice can actually alter the course of someone’s life.<sup>3</sup>
No matter what it is, it can either be a positive or a negative experience.<sup>4</sup>
And that realization didn’t hit me until later in life.<sup>5</sup>
  <strong>I was born on December 24 of 2005</strong>, I was the youngest of three siblings.<sup>6</sup>
My mother and father’s hometown are both located in Mindanao.<sup>7</sup>
I remember having to go on a 3 day road trip just to visit my grandmother and grandfather, I didn't know it at that moment,<strong> I was having the best time of my life.</strong><sup>8</sup>
Because of all those experiences, I developed a sense of taste for road trips.<sup>9</sup>
With the smell of trees and green fields breeze rushing through the windows of the car with music that makes you feel so nostalgic.<sup>10</sup>
The food you eat during brunch or a midnight snack that’s either a home cooked meal or from restaurants or fast foods that we passed.<sup>11</sup>
The excitement you feel when there’s a great view like the ocean, forest, and mountains during sunsets, mornings or even late at night.<sup>12</sup>
These moments felt like an escape from reality, a world where freedom from earthly concepts truly exist.<sup>13</sup>
That’s why I’ll probably go on a lot more adventures when I earn my work money.<sup>14</sup>
<strong>My childhood was filled with great memories.</strong><sup>15</sup>
I was the kid who didn’t care about what kind of person you were, if you didn’t do anything wrong with me then<strong> there’s no reason for me not to talk to you.</strong><sup>16</sup>
That’s why I always had a problem with adults, they always seem to nitpick what’s wrong about a kid and what’s so great about them.<sup>17</sup>
They’re literal kids, what’s wrong if they move, act, and have fun differently from the other kids.<sup>18</sup>
When I was in 5th grade I changed schools.<sup>19</sup>
I didn’t know by then that those actions were actually the norm.<sup>20</sup>
Still little by little, those condescending or confidence boosting words, pierced my mentality, chaining my inner peace.<sup>21</sup>

    <h2 id="teen" style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times, serif; font-size: 30px"> Teenage Years </h2>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In high school, as if the word itself wasn’t bad enough, I was struck by the most dreadful experience of my life.<sup>1</sup>
Puberty hit me like a storm I never signed up for.<sup>2</sup>
I was suddenly plagued with insecurities from head to toe.<sup>3</sup>
I began to think that being mature, confident, and attractive during teenage years should honestly be considered a crime.<sup>4</sup>
It was during this confusing time that I was introduced to cliques.<sup>5</sup>
I didn’t know what to expect or who I was supposed to belong to.<sup>6</sup>
My teenage years felt like a long tunnel where I couldn’t find the light.<sup>7</sup>
I kept trying to figure out who I was supposed to be.<sup>8</sup>
I slowly felt disconnected from the people I genuinely cared about.<sup>9</sup>
I lost my spark without even noticing it slip away.<sup>10</sup>
When I was younger, I could talk to anyone without hesitation.<sup>11</sup>
I could become friends with every classmate like it was the easiest thing in the world.<sup>12</sup>
I would jump from friend group to friend group just to start a conversation.<sup>13</sup>
And then the pandemic happened, and that small loneliness I felt became something bigger.<sup>14</sup>
I already felt alone, but now I became more alone.<sup>15</sup>
Two years of being separated from normal teenage life pushed me into being chronically online.<sup>16</sup>
I spent hours scrolling through every social media platform I could escape into.<sup>17</sup>
Somehow, in all that digital noise, I slowly learned how to reflect on myself.<sup>18</sup>
I started discovering who I wanted to become, even if it was only little by little.<sup>19</sup>
I began drawing out of boredom, and even as a self-taught artist, it led me to win a few digital poster-making competitions.<sup>20</sup>
It was only school-based so it wasn’t that special, but it meant something to me.<sup>21</sup>
And even though my family and I were together 24/7 during the lockdown, I felt more distant from them than ever before.<sup>22</sup>
Maybe it was the teenage phase, maybe it was something else, but it made me want to become so rich that I could live like a potato in my remaining years.<sup>23</sup>

    <h3 id="college" style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times, serif; font-size: 30px">College Years</h3>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Pre-college became the shift from being locked inside our rooms to actually facing people again.<sup>1</sup>
It marked the beginning of my senior high school life.<sup>2</sup>
I suddenly felt like the world was giving me a new chance.<sup>3</sup>
I joined clubs, varsity groups, and even chorale just to use whatever talents I had.<sup>4</sup>
I pushed myself into spaces I used to be scared of.<sup>5</sup>
I even became president of the English club and handled events I never imagined leading.<sup>6</sup>
I slowly changed from someone who struggled to hold a simple conversation into someone who made friends easily.<sup>7</sup>
It felt refreshing, almost like a rebirth.<sup>8</sup>
I was overjoyed by the new version of myself.<sup>9</sup>
But joy, as usual, didn’t last as long as I hoped.<sup>10</sup>
There was still this part of me that resisted acceptance.<sup>11</sup>
It was heavy, like a weight I didn’t want to admit existed.<sup>12</sup>
College came, and I followed in my sister's footsteps by choosing UE.<sup>13</sup>
With the help of a friend and some talent I barely acknowledged, I earned a scholarship.<sup>14</sup>
It felt like I was finally getting the college experience I used to dream about.<sup>15</sup>
But with dreams came pressure I wasn’t prepared for.<sup>16</sup>
I would wake up in the middle of the night because of stress I didn’t know how to handle.<sup>17</sup>
And then came the hardest part, my entire friend group from SHS transferred back to our hometown.<sup>18</sup>
It felt like the world took away my safety net in one quick move.<sup>19</sup>
A part of the pressure disappeared, but a different kind of pressure grew in its place.<sup>20</sup>
I wanted to be perfect because I feared that even one wrong decision would hurt not only me but also the people who trusted me.<sup>21</sup>
It became too heavy at times, but my scholarship eased the burden on my family.<sup>22</sup>
And despite everything, I still managed to hang out with new friends and balance the chaos that came with college life.<sup>23</sup>
