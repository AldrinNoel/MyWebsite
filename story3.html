            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I knew myself until I met my friends. I always believed I had my life figured out. I wanted to live in comfort, away from troubles, and just exist in peace. I imagined myself working in isolation, in a place where sand touched my toes and I could see the ocean or a calm lake right in front of me. I could actually feel the refreshing breeze brushing past my skin, blowing the wind chimes that would sing me into a relaxing sleep. Back then, that life felt like everything I wanted, like it was enough for me.

                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After I graduate, I wanted to start working right away. I planned to build a career in cloud
                engineering, make a steady income, and eventually create a business empire that would sustain
                me for the rest of my life. That was what I thought I would always do. I was convinced that
                focusing on stability and success was just how life was supposed to be, and honestly, I was
                fine with that.
            </p>

            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then I met the people around me, and things slowly changed. It is actually true that the people you surround yourself with affect how you think and how you act, sometimes in ways you do not even notice at first. Because of them, I realized that spending the rest of my life by myself would feel meaningless. I want to be with people who make me laugh, cry, and feel like
                I am accepted for who I want to be.
            </p>

            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is where the conflict comes in. I cannot just force myself into people’s lives. I sometimes feel scared that my future might be left with no one but me. But I also learned that if the people I treasure do not treasure me the same way, that is actually not my problem. I did not need to try so hard. I just needed the right people.

            <p>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, my goal is no longer just to survive or live comfortably. It is not only about money or success. My goal is actually to live, like really live, with meaning, connection, and people who make life feel real. And honestly, that future feels more fulfilling than the quiet, isolated life I once thought I wanted.
